I am an assistant professor at the department of aerospace engineering at TU Delft, the Netherlands. My research aims to improve our understanding and mitigation of the climate impact of aviation, primarily by combining observational data and models. 

If you are a student interested in doing research on these topics, please get in touch! Some ideas for new projects can be found on the <a href='projects'>projects</a> page.
