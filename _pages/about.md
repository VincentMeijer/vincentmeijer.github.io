I am an Assistant Professor at the [Faculty of Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/), the Netherlands. I am part of the [Aircraft Noise and Climate Effects group](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ae/organisation/departments/control-and-operations/aircraft-noise-and-climate-effects-ance). My research aims to improve our understanding and mitigation of the climate impact of aviation, primarily by combining observational data and models. 

If you are a student interested in doing research on these topics, please get in touch! Some ideas for new projects can be found on the <a href='projects'>projects</a> page.
